A stage can provide a "window" between Snowflake and a cloud folder. (RIGHT ONE) 
A stage is often intended as a temporary location for data. Data is put there on it's way to longer term location. (RIGHT ONE) 
A stage can be used as a counter to generate unique ids for each new row in a table. We assign a starting value and an increment.
A stage allows us to group database tables. For example, we created 3 stages in the GARDEN_PLANTS database. One was named VEGGIES. .
